# Resolving Microphone Issues with Noise Suppression App - for Microsoft Teams

This was a project I completed during my bootcamp training, helping a co-student (install software) to suppress the background noises their microphone was picking up during our Zoom call sessions. 

I've re-created this project to work in an IT corporate setting, changing the video/conferencing platform from Zoom to Microsoft Teams and recreating this issue as a support ticket. 

This project aims to resolve the issue of "disruptive background noises" during virtual meetings and calls, by deploying a Virtual Microphone/Noise Suppression solution that easily integrates with Microsoft Teams.

# Introduction

> **VGM-LAB Game Dev Studios** - an independant video game development company, facing a significant challenge in maintaining effective virtual collaboration and communication as its <ins>reliance on remote work</ins> and <ins>Microsoft Teams</ins> has increased.

The company's open office layout and lack of soundproofing means that remote employees' microphones are picking up <ins>distracting background noise</ins> from their on-site colleagues' conversations and surrounding office equipment. 

This issue was further escalated by the fact that some of **VGM LAB**'s remote employees were working from home offices with poor acoustics, experiencing issues with <ins>voice echoes</ins> and <ins>room reverb</ins>, causing confusion during virtual meetings.

To make matters worse, **VGM LAB**'s clients were also experiencing <ins>poor audio quality</ins> during video calls and product demonstrations, making it difficult for them to hear and understand the game developers.

### üè¢ Company Background:
- The client is a small-sized Game Development company, outsourcing the management of their IT services to our Cloud Support Team.
- Their reliance on remote meetings has increased due to more team members working from home, with Microsoft Teams being their primary platform for virtual collaboration.
- Frustrations include poor microphone/audio quality and background noises disrupting the flow of virtual calls and meetings.

## ‚õî Problem Statement:
Our Support Team received a high volume of tickets related to microphone issues in Microsoft Teams. The problems ranged from:

- ‚ùå Background Noises - being audible and distracting callers
- ‚ùå Voice Echoes - causing confusion during client meetings and team discussions
- ‚ùå Muffled Audio - callers unable to hear speaker clearly


## üí° Solution:
To address the microphone issues, I deployed a Virtual Microphone and Noise Suppression solution called `Krisp`. Krisp is a cloud-based software that can integrate directly with `Microsoft Teams`. 

Krisp was able to address each of the identified problem statements and offered the following key features:
- ‚úÖ Background Noise Cancellation
  - *(removing disruptive office sounds and background conversations)*
- ‚úÖ Echo Removal
  - *(eliminating voice or room echoes from any environment)* 
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Voice Quality
  - *(improving clarity and volume balance between speaker and caller)*

# üíª Implementation:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation and Testing:
I created a test enviroment, using `Hyper-V` virtual machines to mimic the users' Microsoft Teams setup. This included the exact software configurations, hardware specs and room conditions that the end-users would be using.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Software Deployment:
I created 2 deployment options for installing Krisp, to work for each use-case scenario.

Because TeamViewer lacked a built-in, voice calling feature, I used Zoom instead to communicate with the client. Providing timely responses to their requests and questions.

`PowerShell` 

<ins>Installing **Bitwarden** with *Windows Package Manager*</ins>: `winget`

```powershell
# Check if winget is installed
$wingetInstalled = Get-Command winget -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Install winget if it's not installed
if (-not $wingetInstalled) {
    Write-Host "Installing winget..."
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.appxbundle" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Add-AppxPackage -Path "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Write-Host "winget installed successfully."
}

# Install Bitwarden using winget
Write-Host "Installing Bitwarden..."
winget install Bitwarden.Bitwarden -e
Write-Host "Bitwarden installed successfully."

```
> [!NOTE]
> This script automates the downloading and silent installation of Bitwarden, reducing the manual effort and time needed to search for and run the installer.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Training and Support:
During the training session, the client was concerned they wouldn't remember how to use the Password Manager, so I offered to create a video tutorial to serve as a reference, in case they ever forgot the correct action steps and needed reminding.  

To produce the Video Tutorial, I used an `AI Step Recorder` to capture my mouse movements and automate the screen recording and annotation process, demonstrating how to use the Password Manager. I produced the final video, using a `Video Editor` to include voice narration, subtitles and timestamps.
